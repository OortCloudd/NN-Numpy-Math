Implementation by hand of a neural network with only Numpy & Math

I trained a Neural Network to predict handwritten numbers from images (MNIST dataset) and achieved >90% accuracy.

I used a forward propagation with a softmax function before implementing backpropagation.

This was a fun one to make. No deployment, no direct business application but it was an important step to enhance my understanding of AI.



I'm a strong believer that you need foundational knowledge before anything else. Mathematics, computer science, statistics...They are the backbone of Artificial Intelligence.
